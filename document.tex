\chapter{A Further Point}
\section{Well hey there}
This section is about making it easier to become a better programmer at \TeX. I hope you all get a lot out of it. What I want to convey is the sense of speed that you can get when creating documents in the whole systsem of \LaTeX. Here, I can concentrate onn the content of my document without actually worrying about the formatting at all. This is usefull because it means that I can save a lot of time making sure that my content is as good at it can be. I wish to make sure that these people are not only, on the path to enlightenment but have that energy to help one another.

Well This is pretty cool I'd like to see if this actually works becuase this would make the production of documents really easy and neat. Text wrapping is important because it links the figure with the text in a way that having it separately from the text can't achieve.
